1.  Introduction

   OpenAPI Specification [OAS] is a consolidated standard for describing
   HTTP APIs using the JSON [JSON] and YAML [YAML] data format.

   To increase interoperability and leverage content negotiation
   mechanisms when exchanging API descriptions this specification
   registers the following media types: application/openapi+json and
   application/openapi+yaml.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   The terms "content", "content negotiation", "resource", and "user
   agent" in this document are to be interpreted as in [HTTP].

2.  Media Type registrations

   This section describes the information required for IANA to register
   the above media types per [MEDIATYPE].

2.1.  The OpenAPI Media Types

   The OpenAPI Specification Media Types convey semantics for OpenAPI
   resources as defined in [OAS].

   Those resources can be represented in [JSON] or [YAML].  Since there
   are multiple OpenAPI Specification versions, those media types
   support the version parameter.

   The following example conveys the desire of a client to receive an
   OpenAPI Specification resource based on the stated preferences:

   1.  openapi 3.1 in YAML

   2.  openapi 3.0 in YAML

   3.  any openapi version in JSON

   Accept: application/openapi+yaml;version=3.1,
           application/openapi+yaml;version=3.0;q=0.5,
           application/openapi+json;q=0.3

2.1.1.  Media Type application/openapi+json

   The following information serves as the registration form for the
   application/openapi+json media type.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  openapi+json

   Required parameters:  None

   Optional parameters:  version: its value is a string representing the
      OpenAPI Specification version. ; unrecognized parameters should be
      ignored

   Encoding considerations:  Same as "application/json"

   Security considerations:  See Section 4 of this document,
      "application/json" and [OAS]

   Interoperability considerations:  See Section 3 of this document,
      "application/json" and [OAS]

   Published specification:  this document, [OAS]

   Applications that use this media type:  HTTP

   Fragment identifier considerations:  [OAS] or the specific version of
      the OpenAPI document.

2.1.2.  Media Type application/openapi+yaml

   The following information serves as the registration form for the
   application/openapi+yaml media type.

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  openapi+yaml

   Required parameters:  N/A

   Optional parameters:  version: its value is a string representing the
      OpenAPI Specification version. ; unrecognized parameters should be
      ignored

   Encoding considerations:  Same as "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix

   Security considerations:  See Section 4 of this document, "+yaml"
      Structured Syntax Suffix and [OAS]

   Interoperability considerations:  See Section 3 of this document,
      "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix and [OAS]

3.  Interoperability Considerations

   Interoperability requirements for media type registrations are
   discussed in Section 4.6 of [MEDIATYPE] and in the Interoperability
   Considerations of the "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix.

3.1.  Using the version parameter

   The version parameter ought to be processed according with the
   associated OpenAPI Specification.

   For example, when an OpenAPI 3.1 resource uses the patch version
   version=3.1.1, its value is expected to be ignored by tooling (see
   https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0.html#versions).

   While it is possible to use the version parameter to identify OpenAPI
   resources prior to version 3.0, the terminology used in this document
   was formally introduced in OAS 3.0.4 and OAS 3.1.1.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security requirements for media type registrations are discussed in
   Section 4.6 of [MEDIATYPE]. and in the Security Considerations of the
   "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix.

4.1.  General Considerations

   OpenAPI documents are processed by a wide variety of tooling for
   numerous different purposes, such as client code generation,
   documentation generation, server side routing, and API testing.
   OpenAPI document authors must consider the risks of the scenarios
   where the OpenAPI document may be used.

   An OpenAPI document describes the security schemes used to protect
   the resources it defines.  The security schemes available offer
   varying degrees of protection.  Factors such as the sensitivity of
   the data and the potential impact of a security breach should guide
   the selection of security schemes for the API resources.  Some
   security schemes, such as basic auth and OAuth Implicit flow, are
   supported for compatibility with existing APIs.  However, their
   inclusion in OpenAPI does not constitute an endorsement of their use,
   particularly for highly sensitive data or operations.

   OpenAPI documents may contain references to external resources that
   may be dereferenced automatically by consuming tools.  External
   resources may be hosted on different domains that may be untrusted.
   References in an OpenAPI document, or across OpenAPI documents may
   cause a cycle.  Tooling must detect and handle cycles to prevent
   resource exhaustion.

   Certain properties allow the use of Markdown which can contain HTML
   including script.  It is the responsibility of tooling to
   appropriately sanitize the Markdown.

   OpenAPI documents use [jsonschema] therefore share the security
   consideration of JSON Schema.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines the following new Internet media types
   [MEDIATYPE].

   IANA is asked to update the "Media Types" registry at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types) with the registration
   information provided in the sections below.

      +==========================+==================================+
      | Media Type               | Registration information section |
      +==========================+==================================+

FAQ

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   Q: Why this document?  After all these years, we still lack a proper
      media type for REST related document types.  This has some
      security implications too (eg. wrt on identifying parsers or treat
      downloads)

Examples of content negotiation

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   This section explores the possibilities for User Agents to retrieve
   information about API specifications using their preferred version of
   OpenAPI.

Scenarios

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   An API catalog exposes API specifications using OAS 3.0, and it wants
   to provide migration/upgrade capabilities to future versions of OAS
   and JSON Schema.  For simplicity, we use only YAML serialization.

   Resource: https://example.org/openapi.yaml  is an OpenAPI
      Specification document that references the Foo schema located at
      /foo.yaml.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Location: openapi.yaml
   Content-Type: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.0

   openapi: 3.0.0
   …
   components:
     schemas:
       Foo:
         "$ref": "/foo.yaml"

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Location: openapi.yaml
   Content-Type: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.2

   openapi: 3.2.0
   "$self": https://example.com/openapi.yaml
   …
   components:
     schemas:
       Foo:
         "$ref": /foo.yaml

   Resource: https://example.org/foo.yaml  is the schema definition for
      Foo, represented in two different ways depending on the OpenAPI
      version requested.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Location: foo.yaml
   Content-Type: application/whatever+yaml

   type: string
   enum: [ it, en]

   Since OAS 3.2 supports JSON Schema, the same syntax can be described
   adding a title to each enum value.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Location: foo.yaml
   Content-Type: application/whatever+yaml

   "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
   "$id": "https://example.com/foo.yaml"
   oneOf:
   - const: it
     title: Italian
   - const: en
     title: English

Scenario 1

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   The User Agent only supports OAS3.0 and refuses other formats,
   including the more generic ones (see Section 12.4.3 of [HTTP].

   GET /openapi.yaml HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: \
     application/openapi+yaml; version=3.0,
     */*; q=0

   The server responds with the desired resource.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.0

   openapi: 3.0.0
   …
   components:
     schemas:
       Foo:
         "$ref": /foo.yaml

   The User Agent processes the content and to resolve the $ref,
   requests the /foo.yaml.

   It needs to retrieve a content compatible with the entry document.
   While the User Agent expects a JSON or YAML serialized content,
   compatible with OAS3.0, it cannot know the actual format that the
   server will return.

   GET /foo.yaml HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.0; q=1, application/yaml; q=0.5

   The server responds with a YAML serialized content that is compatible
   with OAS3.0.  Since the content only contains a Schema Object, that
   is not associated with any media type, the server uses the
   application/yaml media type.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/yaml

   type: string
   enum: [it, en]

Scenario 2

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   The User Agent prefers OAS3.2; moreover uses the q parameter to
   decline OAS3.0 documents.  If it weren't so, the server could have
   responded with the older version if the OAS3.2 document were not
   available.

   GET /openapi.yaml HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.2, application/openapi+yaml; version=3.0;q=0

   The server responds with the OAS3.2 document.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.2

   openapi: 3.0.0
   …
   components:
     schemas:
       Foo:
         "$ref": /foo.yaml

   The User Agent then requests the /foo.yaml, but it wants to retrieve
   a content with the most recent OAS version.

   GET /foo.yaml HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.2

   The server processes the Accept header, and it realizes that the User
   Agent prefers an OAS3.2 compatible content.  It then choses the JSON
   Schema representation and responds accordingly.

   Since JSON Schema has no associated media type, the server uses the
   application/yaml media type.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/yaml

   "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
   "$id": "https://example.com/foo.yaml"
   oneOf:
   - const: it
     title: Italian
   - const: en
     title: English

Scenario 3

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   In this scenario:

   1.  the User Agent express preference for referenced resources
       compatible with OAS3.2.

   2.  The server enforces a strict content negotiation, and responds
       with a 406 Not Acceptable;

   3.  the User Agent will have to retry using one of the acceptable
       media types.

   The User Agent prefers OAS3.2; moreover uses the q parameter to
   decline OAS3.0 documents.  If it weren't so, the server could have
   responded with the older version if the OAS3.2 document were not
   available.

   GET /openapi.yaml HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.2, application/openapi+yaml; version=3.0;q=0

   The server responds with the OAS3.2 document.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.2

   openapi: 3.0.0
   …
   components:
     schemas:
       Foo:
         "$ref": /foo.yaml

   The User Agent then requests the /foo.yaml, but it wants to retrieve
   a content with the most recent OAS version.

   GET /foo.yaml HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: application/openapi+yaml; version=3.2

   The server processes the Accept header, and it realizes that foo.yaml
   is a JSON Schema document and not an OpenAPI document.

   It then replies with the acceptable content.

   HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
   Accept: \
     application/whatever+yaml; version=https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema, \
     application/whatever+yaml; version=https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.4#schema-object

   The User Agent decides to retry the request using one of the
   acceptable media types.  It could have also decided to give up.

   GET /foo.yaml HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Accept: \
     application/whatever+yaml; version=https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema

   Now the server can respond with the JSON Schema representation.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/whatever+yaml; version=https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema

   "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"
   "$id": "https://example.com/foo.yaml"
   oneOf:
   - const: it
     title: Italian
   - const: en
     title: English

   Pros:

   *  The returned content is exactly what the User Agent requested.

   Cons:

   *  Two requests were needed to retrieve the resource.

   *  Some User Agents may not be able to handle the 406 Not Acceptable
      response and give up.

   *  Requires a specific Accept value for each possible referenced
      resource, which may be difficult to manage.

   *  Clients may not be able to
