# Introduction

OpenAPI Specification [oas] version 3 and above
is a consolidated standard for describing
HTTP APIs using the JSON {{!JSON=RFC8259}} and YAML [YAML] data format.

YAML media type registration is addressed in {{!YAML-MEDIATYPES=I-D.ietf-httpapi-yaml-mediatypes}},
which provides interoperability and security considerations.

To increase interoperability when processing API specifications
and leverage content negotiation mechanisms when exchanging
OpenAPI Specification resources
this specification register the following media-types:
`application/schema+json`,
`application/schema-instance+json`,
`application/openapi+json`
and `application/openapi+yaml`.

## Notational Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14+}

This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in {{!RFC5234}} and updated
by {{!RFC7405}}.

The terms  "content", "content negotiation", "resource",
and "user agent"
in this document are to be interpreted as in {{!SEMANTICS=I-D.ietf-httpbis-semantics}}.

# Media Type registrations

This section describes the information required to register
the above media types according to {{!MEDIATYPE=RFC6838}}

## The OpenAPI Media Types

The OpenAPI Specification Media Types convey OpenAPI document (OAS) files
as defined in [oas] for version 3.0.0 and above.

Those files can be serialized in {{JSON}} or [YAML].
Since there are multiple OpenAPI Specification versions,
those media-types support the `version` parameter.

The following examples conveys the desire of a client
to receive an OpenAPI Specification resource preferably in the following
order:

1. openapi 3.1 in YAML
2. openapi 3.0 in YAML
3. any openapi version in json

~~~ example

Accept: application/openapi+yaml;version=3.1,
        application/openapi+yaml;version=3.0;q=0.5,
        application/openapi+json;q=0.3

## JSON Schema Media Types

JSON Schema is a declarative domain-specific language for validating and
annotating JSON documents (see {{jsonschema}}).

This document registers the media types associated with JSON Schema.

There are many dialects of JSON Schema in wide use today. The JSON Schema
maintainers have released several dialects including draft-04, draft-07, and
draft 2020-12. There are also several third-party JSON Schema dialects in wide
use including the ones defined for use in OpenAPI and MongoDB.

This specification defines little more than how to identify the dialect while
leaving most of the semantics of the schema up to the dialect to define. Clients
MUST use the following order of precedence for determining the dialect of a
schema.

* The `$schema` keyword ({{schema-keyword}})
* The "schema" media type parameter ({{schema-parameter}})
* The context of the enclosing document. This applies only when a schema is
  embedded within a document. The enclosing document could be another schema in
  the case of a bundled schema or it could be another type of document that
  includes schemas such as an OpenAPI document.
* If none of the above result in identifying the dialect, client behavior is
  undefined.

### The "$schema" Keyword {#schema-keyword}

The `$schema` keyword is used as a JSON Schema dialect identifier. The value of
this keyword MUST be a URI {{!RFC3986}}. This URI SHOULD identify a meta-schema
that can be used to validate that the schema is syntactically correct according
to the dialect the URI identifies.

The dialect SHOULD define where the `$schema` keyword is allowed and/or
recognized in a schema, but it is RECOMMENDED that dialects do not allow the
schema to change within the same Schema Resource.

### Identifying a Schema via a Media Type Parameter {#schema-parameter}

Media types MAY allow for a `schema` media type parameter, to support content
negotiation based on schema identifier (see  {{Section 12 of SEMANTICS}}).
The `schema` media type parameter MUST be a URI-reference {{!RFC3986}}.

The `schema` parameter identifies a schema that provides semantic information
about the resource the media type represents. When using the
`application/schema+json` media type, the `schema` parameter identifies the
dialect of the schema the media type represents.

The `schema` URI is opaque and SHOULD NOT automatically be dereferenced. Since
`schema` doesn't necessarily point to a network location, the "describedby"
relation is used for linking to a downloadable schema.

The following is an example of content negotiation where a user agent can accept
two different versions of a "pet" resource. Each resource version is identified
by a unique JSON Schema.

Request:

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

GET /pet/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Accept: \
  application/schema-instance+json; schema="/schemas/v2/pet"; q=0.2, \
  application/schema-instance+json; schema="/schemas/v1/pet"; q=0.1
~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
Content-Type: \
  application/schema-instance+json; schema="/schemas/v2/pet"

{
  "petId": "1234",
  "name": "Pluto",
  ...
}
~~~

In the following example, the user agent is able to accept two possible dialects
of JSON Schema and the server replies with the latest one.

Request:

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

GET /schemas/v2/pet HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Accept: application/schema+json; \
            schema="https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema", \
        application/schema+json; \
            schema="http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#"
~~~

Response:

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: \
  application/schema+json; \
      schema="https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"

{
  "$id": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  ...
}
~~~

### Linking to a Schema {#schema-linking}

It is RECOMMENDED that instances described by a schema provide a link to a
downloadable JSON Schema using the link relation `describedby`, as defined by
Linked Data Protocol 1.0, section 8.1 {{!W3C.REC-ldp-20150226}}.

In HTTP, such links can be attached to any response using the `Link` header
{{!LINK=RFC8288}}.

~~~
Link: <https://example.com/my-hyper-schema#>; rel="describedby"
~~~

### Fragment Identifiers {#schema-fragment}

Two fragment identifier structures are supported: JSON Pointers and plain-names.

The use of JSON Pointers as URI fragment identifiers is described in
{{!RFC6901}}. Fragment identifiers that are empty or start with a `/`, MUST be
interpreted as JSON Pointer fragment identifiers.

Plain-name fragment identifiers reference locally named locations in the
document. The dialect determines how plain-name identifiers map to locations
within the document. All fragment identifiers that do not match the JSON Pointer
syntax MUST be interpreted as plain name fragment identifiers.

### Media Type application/schema+json {#schema-json}

The `application/schema+json` media type represents JSON Schema. This schema can
be an official dialect or a third-party dialect. The following information
serves as the registration form for the `application/schema+json` media type.

**Type name**: application

**Subtype name**: schema+json

**Required parameters**: N/A

**Optional parameters**:

* **schema**: A URI identifying the JSON Schema dialect the schema was written
  for. If this value conflicts with the value of the `$schema` keyword in the
  schema, the `$schema` keyword takes precedence.

**Encoding considerations**: Same as {{JSON}}

**Security considerations**: See the "Security Considerations" section of
{{jsonschema}}

**Interoperability considerations**: See the "General Considerations" section of
{{jsonschema}}

**Published specification**: (this document)

**Applications that use this media type**: JSON Schema is used in a variety of
applications including API servers and clients that validate JSON requests and
responses, IDEs that valid configuration files, databases that store JSON, and
more.

**Fragment identifier considerations**: See {{schema-fragment}}

**Additional information**:

  * **Deprecated alias names for this type**: N/A

  * **Magic number(s)**: N/A

  * **File extension(s)**: json, schema.json

  * **Macintosh file type code(s)**: N/A

**Person and email address to contact for further information**: See Authors'
Addresses section.

**Intended usage**: COMMON

**Restrictions on usage**: N/A.

**Author**: See Authors' Addresses section.

**Change controller**: N/A

### Media Type application/schema-instance+json {#schema-instance-json}

The `application/schema-instance+json` media type is an extension of the
{{JSON}} media type that just adds the `schema` media type parameter and
fragment identification. The following information serves as the registration
form for the `application/schema-instance+json` media type.

**Type name**: application

**Subtype name**: schema-instance+json

**Required parameters**: N/A

**Optional parameters**:

* **schema**: A URI identifying a JSON Schema that provides semantic information
  about this JSON representation.

**Encoding considerations**: Same as {{JSON}}

**Security considerations**: Same as {{JSON}}

**Interoperability considerations**: Same as {{JSON}}

**Published specification**: (this document)

**Applications that use this media type**: JSON Schema is used in a variety of
applications including API servers and clients that validate JSON requests and
responses, IDEs that valid configuration files, databases that store JSON, and
more.

**Fragment identifier considerations**: See {{schema-fragment}}

**Additional information**:

# FAQ
{: numbered="false"}

Q: Why this document?
:  After all these years, we still lack a proper media-type for YAML.
   This has some security implications too
   (eg. wrt on identifying parsers or treat downloads)
