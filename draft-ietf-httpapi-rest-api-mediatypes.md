--- abstract

This document registers
the following media types used in APIs
on the IANA Media Types registry:
application/openapi+json,
and application/openapi+yaml.

# Introduction

OpenAPI Specification [OAS] version 3 and above
is a consolidated standard for describing
HTTP APIs using the JSON {{JSON}} and YAML [YAML] data format.

To increase interoperability when processing API descriptions
and leverage content negotiation mechanisms when exchanging
OpenAPI description representations
this specification registers the following media types:
`application/openapi+json`
and `application/openapi+yaml`.

## Notational Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14+}

The terms  "content", "content negotiation", "resource",
and "user agent"
in this document are to be interpreted as in {{HTTP}}.

# Media Type registrations

This section describes the information required to register
the above media types according to {{MEDIATYPE}}.

## The OpenAPI Media Types

The OpenAPI Specification Media Types convey semantics for OpenAPI Document (OAD) resources
as defined in [OAS] for version 3.0 and above.

Those resources can be represented in {{JSON}} or [YAML].
Since there are multiple OpenAPI Specification versions,
those media types support the `version` parameter.

The following example conveys the desire of a client
to receive an OpenAPI Document resource based on the stated
preferences:

1. openapi 3.1 in YAML
2. openapi 3.0 in YAML
3. any openapi version in JSON

~~~ example

Accept: application/openapi+yaml;version=3.1,
        application/openapi+yaml;version=3.0;q=0.5,
        application/openapi+json;q=0.3
~~~

### Media Type application/openapi+json {#openapi-json}

The following information serves as the registration form for the `application/openapi+json` media type.

Type name:
: application

Subtype name:
: openapi+json

Required parameters:
: None

Optional parameters:
: version: its value is a string representing
  the OpenAPI Specification version.
  ;  unrecognized parameters should be ignored

Encoding considerations:
: Same as "application/json"

Security considerations:
: See {{sec}} of this document, "application/json" and [OAS]

Interoperability considerations:
: See {{int}} of this document, "application/json" and [OAS]

Published specification:
: this document, [OAS]

Applications that use this media type:
: HTTP

Fragment identifier considerations:
: [OAS] or the specific version
  of the OpenAPI document.

Additional information:

- Deprecated alias names for this type:  "application/vnd.oai.openapi+json". This name is used, but not registered.

- Magic number(s):  N/A

- File extension(s):  json

- Macintosh file type code(s):  N/A

Person and email address to contact for further information:
: See Authors' Addresses section.

Intended usage:
: COMMON

Restrictions on usage:
: None.

Author:
: See Authors' Addresses section.

### Media Type application/openapi+yaml {#openapi-yaml}

The following information serves as the registration form for the `application/openapi+yaml` media type.

Type name:
: application

Subtype name:
: openapi+yaml

Required parameters:
: N/A

Optional parameters:
: version: its value is a string representing
  the OpenAPI Specification version.
  ; unrecognized parameters should be ignored

Encoding considerations:
: Same as "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix

Security considerations:
: See {{sec}} of this document, "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix and [OAS]

Interoperability considerations:
: See {{int}} of this document, "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix and [OAS]

Published specification:
: [OAS]

Applications that use this media type:
: HTTP

Fragment identifier considerations:
: [OAS] or the specific version
  of the OpenAPI document.

Additional information:

- Deprecated alias names for this type: "application/vnd.oai.openapi". This name is used, but not registered.

- Magic number(s):  N/A

- File extension(s): Same as "application/yaml"

- Macintosh file type code(s):  N/A

Person and email address to contact for further information:

Intended usage:
:  COMMON

Restrictions on usage:
:  None.

# Interoperability Considerations {#int}

Interoperability requirements for media type
registrations are discussed in Section 4.6 of {{!MEDIATYPE=RFC6838}}
and in the Interoperability Considerations of the "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix.

# Security Considerations {#sec}

Security requirements for media type
registrations are discussed in Section 4.6 of {{!MEDIATYPE=RFC6838}}.
and in the Security Considerations of the "+yaml" Structured Syntax Suffix.

## General Considerations

OpenAPI documents are processed by a wide variety of tooling for numerous different purposes,
such as client code generation, documentation generation, server side routing, and API testing.
OpenAPI document authors must consider the risks of the scenarios where the OpenAPI document may be used.

An OpenAPI document describes the security schemes used to protect the resources it defines.
The security schemes available offer varying degrees of protection.
Factors such as the sensitivity of the data and the potential impact of a security breach should guide the selection of security schemes for the API resources.
Some security schemes, such as basic auth and OAuth Implicit flow, are supported for compatibility with existing APIs.
However, their inclusion in OpenAPI does not constitute an endorsement of their use,
particularly for highly sensitive data or operations.

OpenAPI documents may contain references to external resources that may be dereferenced automatically by consuming tools.
External resources may be hosted on different domains that may be untrusted.
References in an OpenAPI document, or across OpenAPI documents may cause a cycle.
Tooling must detect and handle cycles to prevent resource exhaustion.

Certain properties allow the use of Markdown which can contain HTML including script.
It is the responsibility of tooling to appropriately sanitize the Markdown.

OpenAPI documents use [jsonschema] therefore share the security consideration of JSON Schema.

# IANA Considerations

This specification defines the following new Internet media types {{MEDIATYPE}}.

IANA is asked to update the "Media Types" registry at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types>
with the registration information provided in the sections below.

|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Media Type                           | Registration information section            |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| application/openapi+json             | {{openapi-json}} of this document           |
| application/openapi+yaml             | {{openapi-yaml}} of this document           |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

and Jason Desrosiers.

# FAQ
{: numbered="false" removeinrfc="true"}

Q: Why this document?
:  After all these years, we still lack a proper media type for REST related document types.
   This has some security implications too
   (eg. wrt on identifying parsers or treat downloads)

# Change Log
