# Introduction

OpenAPI Specification [oas] version 3 and above
is a consolidated standard for describing
HTTP APIs using the JSON {{!JSON=RFC8259}} and yaml [yaml] data format.

To increase interoperability when processing API specifications
and leverage content negotiation mechanisms when exchanging
OpenAPI Specification resources
this specification register the following media-types:
`text/yaml`,
`application/yaml`,
`application/openapi+json`
and `application/openapi+yaml`.

## Notational Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14+}

This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in {{!RFC5234}} and updated
by {{!RFC7405}}.

## The OpenAPI Media Types

The OpenAPI Specification Media Types convey OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files
as defined in [oas] for version 3.0.0 and above.

Those files can be serialized in {{JSON}} or [yaml].
Since there are multiple OpenAPI Specification Specifications versions,
those media-types support the `version` parameter.

The following examples conveys the desire of a client
to receive an OpenAPI Specification resource preferably in the following
order:

1. openapi 3.1 in yaml
2. openapi 3.0 in yaml
3. any openapi version in json

~~~ example

Accept: application/openapi+yaml;version=3.1,
        application/openapi+yaml;version=3.0;q=0.5,
        application/openapi+json;q=0.3
~~~

# Security Considerations

Security requirements for both media type and media type suffix
registrations are discussed in Section 4.6 of {{!MEDIATYPE=RFC6838}}.

# Acknowledgements

This specification was born from a thread created by James Manger
and the subsequent discussion here [https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/885](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/885).

# FAQ
{: numbered="false"}

Q: Why this document?
:  After all these years, we still lack a proper media-type for yaml.
   This has some security implications too
   (eg. wrt on identifying parsers or treat downloads)

Q: Why application/yaml and text/yaml
:  Browsers and libraries implementations treats them differently.
   For example Google Chrome will display pages with
   `Content-Type: text/yaml` and to download pages with
   `Content-Type: application/yaml`.
